== Paragraphs with what would normally be numbered lists

This is a paragraph. And it will wrap to
1 paragraph test, really: 
some number of lines that we'll mumble about, because
2 lines that would normally start a OL, except that even on line
3 it won't.
Really, it won't.

On the other hand, this should work:
# a numbered list.
  and a line that continues:
  1 but this probably should still work?
1 and another one.

And this should work:

0 A numbered list.
1 A numbered list.
